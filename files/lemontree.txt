I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wastin' my time, I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens
I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast, I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah (dah-di-di-dah)
(Sing) dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah (dah-di-di-dah)
I'm sittin' here, I missed the power
I'd like to go out, takin' a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
And I wonder (wonder, wonder, wonder)
dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah
(Sing) dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah
